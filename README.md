# rmi_database
This is a project implementing a binary database using Java. 
It supports a GUI and Network Access via RMI. 
The Database can (currently) be used by compiling the files, starting the Server in src/rmi and starting SwingClient (GUI) in src/swing.
(This establishes a connection between the Server and the Client via 127.0.0.1)
